# 📄 Intelligent Document Chat using RAG & LLMOps

## 📌 Overview
This project implements an **AI-powered document chat system** that enables users to interact conversationally with single or multiple documents. Built using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and modern **LLMOps practices**, the system allows accurate, context-aware question answering over large and unstructured document collections.

The platform is designed for **technical documents, regulations, manuals, and reports**, providing fast, reliable, and explainable responses grounded in source content.

## 🎯 Key Capabilities
- Conversational Q&A over documents
- Support for **single-document** and **multi-document** chat
- Context-aware responses grounded in source text
- Scalable ingestion and retrieval pipelines
- Production-ready APIs and UI integration

## 🧠 System Architecture

The document chat system follows a **RAG-based architecture**:

- **Document Ingestion** – Parses PDFs, Word files, and text documents  
- **Chunking & Indexing** – Splits content into semantic chunks with metadata  
- **Embedding Generation** – Converts text into vector representations  
- **Vector Retrieval** – Retrieves relevant chunks using similarity search  
- **LLM Generation** – Produces grounded responses using retrieved context  
- **Session Memory** – Maintains conversational continuity across turns  

Advanced retrieval techniques are applied to improve response relevance and reduce hallucinations.

## 🔧 Core Technologies
- **LLMs:** Large Language Models for response generation  
- **RAG Framework:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipelines  
- **Vector Stores:** FAISS / Chroma  
- **Embeddings:** Hugging Face / OpenAI-compatible models  
- **Backend:** FastAPI for model serving  
- **UI:** Streamlit / Gradio  
- **Deployment:** Dockerized services with CI/CD support

## 📂 Workflow
1. User uploads or selects documents  
2. Documents are parsed, chunked, and indexed  
3. User asks questions via chat interface  
4. Relevant document context is retrieved  
5. LLM generates an answer grounded in retrieved content  
6. Response is returned with conversational continuity

## 📈 Use Cases
- Technical documentation assistants  
- Regulatory and compliance document chat  
- Knowledge-base Q&A systems  
- Enterprise document intelligence platforms  
- Research and design support tools  

---

## ✅ Key Design Principles
- **Accuracy:** Responses grounded strictly in retrieved content  
- **Scalability:** Handles large document collections efficiently  
- **Explainability:** Clear traceability to source documents  
- **Extensibility:** Easy integration of new retrievers, models, or UIs
